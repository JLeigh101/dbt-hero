# Configuring models
# Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the example/ directory
# as tables. These settings can be overridden in the individual model files
# using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.

      - "GRANT SELECT ON {{ this }} TO ROLE REPORTER"   #{{this}} is replaced by the actual model when dbt run is called
